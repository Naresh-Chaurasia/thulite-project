### 🌐 Overview

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Generative AI is reshaping multiple domains — but understanding its challenges is essential for safe and effective use.
{{< /callout >}}

Generative AI is transforming **content creation**, **art**, **software development**, **drug discovery**, and more.
However, these opportunities come with significant challenges requiring careful handling.

---

### 🎯 Data Bias

Models learn patterns from historical data.
If the training data contains bias, the model will reproduce and amplify that bias.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Biased datasets → biased AI → unfair and discriminatory outputs.
{{< /callout >}}

**Example:**
An image generator trained mostly on pictures of white men struggles to generate realistic images of women or people of color.

**Mitigation**

- Curate diverse, balanced datasets
- Apply bias-detection and mitigation techniques

### ⚖️ Ethical Concerns

Generative AI introduces several ethical challenges:

- Deepfakes → misinformation, manipulation
- Job displacement → creative fields impacted
- Intellectual property → ownership and plagiarism issues

{{< callout type="danger" >}}
Deepfake misuse is one of the biggest ethical threats posed by generative AI.
{{< /callout >}}

**Mitigation**

- Establish AI ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks

---

### 🧠 Control and Explainability

Generative models may output unpredictable or incorrect content.
Their black-box nature makes it hard to understand *why* a certain result was produced.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make model decisions more transparent and understandable.
{{< /callout >}}

**Mitigation**

- Advance research in Explainable AI (XAI)
- Build better tools for user control and refinement

---

### ⚙️ Resource Requirements

Training large AI models requires massive compute power, datasets, and energy.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
High energy consumption → increased carbon emissions and environmental impact.
{{< /callout >}}

**Mitigation**

- Use energy-efficient architectures
- Adopt optimized training techniques

---

### 🧩 Over-Reliance and De-Skilling

Excessive use of AI can reduce human creativity, originality, and critical thinking.

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
Use AI as a *supporting tool*, not a replacement for human judgment.
{{< /callout >}}

**Mitigation**

- Encourage balanced usage
- Maintain human oversight and review

---

### 📘 Conclusion

{{< callout type="success" >}}
Awareness of generative AI challenges helps in practical understanding and exam preparation.
{{< /callout >}}

Understanding both risks and mitigation strategies ensures responsible and effective AI adoption.
