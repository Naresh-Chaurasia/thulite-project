### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is the **broadest concept**.
It includes *any technique* that enables a computer to mimic human intelligence.

This involves:

- Problem-solving
- Reasoning
- Learning
- Perception

In simple terms, AI is a system that can **analyze data** and **take actions autonomously**, similar to how humans think and act.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
AI = Any system designed to behave intelligently like a human.

### 📘 Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a **subset of AI**.

ML focuses on algorithms that:

- Learn patterns from data
- Make predictions or decisions
- Without being explicitly programmed for the task

Example:
A model learns from past sales data and predicts future sales.

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
ML = Teaching machines to learn from data.

### 🧠 Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning is a **subset of machine learning**.

Here also the system learns patterns from data—but it uses:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**
- These networks are inspired by how the human brain works

Deep learning is powerful for understanding **complex data**, such as:

- Images
- Audio
- Text
- Sensor data

{{< callout type="success" >}}
DL = Machine learning powered by neural networks for complex pattern detection.

### 🔵 Relationship Overview

You can visualize the relationship like **nested circles**:

- **AI** → biggest circle
- **ML** → inside AI
- **DL** → inside ML

### 📌 When to Use Each?

#### ✔️ When to Use Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Use AI when a computer needs to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence—such as decision-making or reasoning.

---

#### ✔️ When to Use Machine Learning (ML)

Use ML when:

- You have a dataset
- You want the machine to learn from the data
- You need predictions or classification

Examples:
Spam detection, price prediction, recommendation systems.

---

#### ✔️ When to Use Deep Learning (DL)

Use DL when the data is:

- Large
- Complex
- High-dimensional

Such as:

- Images
- Videos
- Text
- Speech

Deep Learning is ideal for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, or autonomous driving.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Deep learning requires more data and more computation compared to traditional ML.
