### Introduction

PHILOSOPHER: None of us live in an objective world, but instead in a subjective world that we ourselves have given meaning to. **The world you see is different from the one I see**, and it’s impossible to share your world with anyone else.

PHILOSOPHER: No, it’s not an illusion. You see, to you, in that moment, the coolness or warmth of the **well** water is an undeniable fact. That’s what it means to live in your subjective world. **There is no escape from your own subjectivity. At present, the world seems complicated and mysterious to you, but if you change, the world will appear more simple. The issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are**.

YOUTH: Of course. **If I could change, if I could start life all over again, I would gladly fall to my knees before you**. But it could turn out that you’ll be down on your knees before me.

### The First Night: Deny Trauma

He **lacked self-confidence** and, ever since childhood, this had been compounded by **deep-seated feelings of inferiority** with regard to his personal and academic backgrounds, as well as his **physical appearance**. Perhaps, as a result, he tended to be excessively self-conscious when people looked at him. Mostly, he seemed incapable of truly appreciating other people’s happiness, and was constantly pitying himself. To him, the philosopher’s claims were nothing more than the stuff of fantasy.

#### The Unknown Third Giant


In other words, rather than being a strict area of scholarship, Adlerian psychology is accepted as a realisation; a culmination of truths and of human understanding. **Yet Adler’s ideas are said to have been a hundred years ahead of their time**, and even today we have not managed to fully comprehend them. That is how truly ground breaking they were.

#### Why People Can Change

{{< callout note >}}
**PHILOSOPHER:**
He is not pretending to be sick. The anxiety and fear your friend is feeling are real. On occasion, he might also suffer from migraines and violent stomach cramps. **However, these too are symptoms that he has created in order to achieve the goal of not going out**.

Is it that I have create symptom of perfectionism to avoid people in dance, in work in life etc. Although it has helped me to improve but is has also created void in my life, and pushed people away from me.

#### Trauma Does Not Exist

{{<callout note>}}
But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: "No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure.
We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—**but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes**.
We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining."

It suits me to avoid people, girls in general. It helps me to avoid pain and sorrow, of being hurt, deserted.

**We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences**. Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live.

#### How To Live Without Being Controlled By The Past

We can’t go back to the past in a time machine. We can’t turn back the hands of time. If you end up staying in aetiology, you will be bound by the past and never be able to find happiness.

#### Socrates And Adler

Adler showed little interest in literary activities, preferring personal dialogue at cafés in Vienna and holding small discussion groups. He was definitely not an **armchair intellectual**.

#### Are You Okay Just As You Are?

**PHILOSOPHER:**
**Right now, you are unable to feel really happy. This is because you have not learned to love yourself**. And to try to love yourself, you are wishing to be reborn as a different person. You’re hoping to become like someone else and throw away who you are now.

---

#### Unhappiness Is Something You Choose For Yourself

**PHILOSOPHER:**
At some stage in your life, you chose *being unhappy*. It is not because you were born into unhappy circumstances or ended up in an unhappy situation. **It’s that you judged *being unhappy* to be good for you**.

I chose an unhappy life? Because it was good for me? What an absurd argument! Why is he going to such lengths to ridicule me? What did I do wrong? I’ll dismantle his argument, no matter what it takes. I’ll make him kneel before me.

---

#### People Always Choose Not To Change

You describe yourself as an unhappy person. You say that you want to change right this minute and even claim that you want to be reborn as a different person. After all that, why are you still unable to change?
It is because you are making the persistent decision **not** to change your lifestyle.

---

### Courage to Be Happy

**PHILOSOPHER:**
Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage.
Your unhappiness cannot be blamed on your past or your environment.
It isn’t that you lack competence.
You just lack courage.
One might say you are lacking the courage to be happy.

---

### Loneliness and Relationships

**PHILOSOPHER:**
Being alone isn’t what makes you feel lonely.
Loneliness is having other people, society, and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them.
To feel lonely, we need other people.

You were so afraid of interpersonal relationships that you came to dislike yourself.
You avoided relationships by disliking yourself.

---

### Objective Facts vs Subjective Meaning

**PHILOSOPHER:**
We cannot alter objective facts.
But subjective interpretations can be altered as much as one likes.
We are inhabitants of a subjective world.

---

### Inferiority and Growth

**PHILOSOPHER:**
The pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not diseases.
They are stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth.
Used correctly, the feeling of inferiority promotes growth.

An inferiority complex appears when one uses inferiority as an excuse, such as:
"I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed."

---

### Responsibility for Change

**PHILOSOPHER:**
If you think, "I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed,"
replace it with:
"I don’t want to succeed."

It is scary to take even one step forward.
You don’t want to make realistic efforts or sacrifice present comforts.
That is why you lack the courage to change your lifestyle.

### A New View of the World

**PHILOSOPHER:**
When you are able to truly feel that *people are my comrades*,
your view of the world will change completely.

The world will no longer seem perilous.
It will appear safe and pleasant,
and your interpersonal relationship problems will decrease dramatically.
