* You don’t need to capture every important line from the book to change your life.
* **Whatever you’ve already highlighted and noted is more than enough**.
* Even if you truly apply just 25% of what you’ve written down, your life will shift in meaningful ways—because **transformation doesn’t come from re-reading or perfect notes**, it comes from lived action.
* Books give direction, but implementation gives results.
* **Trust that what mattered most you have already noted, and now your only job is to practice it**.

### 🌱 Introduction and Pre-Chapters

{{< flashcard >}}
When you start loving yourself, life starts loving you, too. By keeping your vibration high, you'll attract more opportunities and blessings into your life.
{{< /flashcard >}}

#### ✨ Introduction

I realize that the good, the bad and the downright ugly events are all a part of who I’ve become.

Although some of them may have been painful, they’re a blessing – they’ve taught me so much. My experiences have left me with a **drive to find a way out of misery and a path towards a better life**.

Some people are comfortable with mediocrity. They avoid living a greater life, one that’s beyond what most consider the norm. A greater life requires you to find your greatness. In simple terms, **greatness is about becoming the greatest version of yourself. It’s about breaking the imaginary boundaries that hold you captive in a life you believe you have to settle for, and touching the realms of the unthinkable**. The greatness mentality means living a life without limits, where there are infinite possibilities. For this reason, we can’t define where greatness begins or ends. We can only strive to become better.

Stop trying to impress people. Impress yourself. Stretch yourself. Test yourself. Be the best version of you that you can be.
{{< /flashcard >}}

This book requires you to commit to a better you right now. My aim is to help you become better than the person you were yesterday, every day, in each and every way, for the rest of your life. If you wake up with this desire in your mind and then consciously follow up on it, you’ll be surprised by how much inspiration you find. Your life will begin to reflect your commitment to progress.

#### 💖 What is self-love?

In this instance, if you’re kind and honest, and follow a fair process, you needn’t feel guilty for taking further action.

{{< flashcard >}}
It’s important to recognize that it’s not unjust to let go of those who show no concern for you.
{{< /flashcard >}}

But true self-love is when you **appreciate where you are and who you are, regardless of any transformation you aspire to**. The second element encourages growth, and the focus is on taking action. **Improving yourself** and your life is also self-love, because it means you recognize that you deserve more than settling for mediocrity.

* When you love yourself, life will begin to love you back.

* Self-love is the balance between accepting yourself as you are while knowing you deserve better, and then working towards it.

* Introduction

* Not everything I’ve wanted has manifested. This has usually been a blessing in disguise. Too many times I’ve believed that I wanted and needed something, but it was for all the wrong reasons. Over the years, I’ve gained clarity and sighed with relief for not getting what I thought was surely meant for me. Often, I’ve not got what I wanted, only to find I’ve later been blessed with even more.

* The Law of Vibration The Universe responds to your vibration.

* It’ll return whatever energy you put out.

* Change the way you think, feel, speak and act, and you begin to change your world.
