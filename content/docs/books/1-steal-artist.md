* You don’t need to capture every important line from the book to change your life.
* **Whatever you’ve already highlighted and noted is more than enough**.
* Even if you truly apply just 25% of what you’ve written down, your life will shift in meaningful ways—because **transformation doesn’t come from re-reading or perfect notes**, it comes from lived action.
* Books give direction, but implementation gives results.
* **Trust that what mattered most you have already noted, and now your only job is to practice it**.

#### 🎨 1. Steal Like an Artist


Every artist gets asked the question,Where do you get your ideas? The honest artist answers,  **I steal them**.

{{< callout original >}}
What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere. **All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original**.Every new idea is just a mashup or a remix of one or more previous ideas.

You don't get to pick your family, **but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see. You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life**. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said, "We are shaped and fashioned by what we love."

**There's an economic** theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income. **You're only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.**

**Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination**. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. **Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic**

**Good** = ideas that keep coming back to your mind; change how you think or act; feel personal, not impressive

* Speed Reading - Jonathan Levi
* Productivity - Josh Paulsen

**Bad (or irrelevant for you)** = ideas that excite you only while reading, need constant rereading to feel important don’t survive a few days
without notes

{{< /callout >}}

Instead, **chew on one thinker**—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. **Study everything there is to know about that thinker**. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it's time to start your own branch.

**The great thing** about dead or remote masters is that they can't refuse you as an apprentice. You can learn whatever you want from them. They left their lesson plans in their work.

School is one thing. Education is another. The two don't always overlap. Whether you're in school or not, it's always your job to get yourself an education.

You have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else — that's how you'll get ahead.

Google everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don't ask a question before you Google it. You'll either find the answer or you'll come up with a better question.

Always be reading. Go to the library. **There's magic in being surrounded by books. Get lost in the stacks. Read bibliographies. It's not the book you start with, it's the book that book leads you to**.

#### 🧭 2. Don't Wait Until You Know Who You Are to Get Started


{{< callout original >}}
**If I'd waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started "being creative," well, I'd still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it's in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are.**
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout comment >}}
Do It. Iterate It. Add Your Style. Rinse It. Repeat It.
{{< /callout >}}

Guess what: None of us do. Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they'll tell you the truth: They don't know where the good stuff comes from.

{{< callout original >}}
They just show up to do their thing. Every day.

* Initally I was struggling so much with PR classes. I kept on trying. I kept going | did my Drills. Now it is happening. I am really enjoying the process and the slow burn.
* That support that I got from people in the batch was really awesome. STAY and KILL it now.
{{< /callout >}}


You have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and **you have to start doing the work you want to be doing**.

**Nobody is born with a style or a voice**. We don't come out of the womb knowing who we are. **In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes. We learn by copying**.

Copying is about reverse-engineering. It's like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works.

{{< callout original >}}
If you copy from one author, it's plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it's research.
{{< /callout >}}

What to copy is a little bit trickier. **Don't just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don't want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes**.

There isn't a move that's a new move." The basketball star Kobe Bryant has admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of his heroes.

{{< callout original >}}
But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn't completely pull them off because he didn't have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own.
{{< /callout >}}


Conan O'Brien has talked about how comedians try to **emulate their heroes, fall short, and end up doing their own thing**.

{{< callout comment >}}
You will either fall short or fall tall. That is the gateway to originality.
{{< /callout >}}


"It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique." Thank goodness.

So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What's in there that makes you different? That's what you should amplify and transform into your own work.

#### 📚 3. Write the Book You Want to Read

The best advice is not to write what you know, it's to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you're at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, "What would make a better story?

When we love a piece of work, we're desperate for more. We crave sequels. Why not channel that desire into something productive?

{{< callout note >}}
The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done.

#### ✋ 4. Use Your Hands

The computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us—we start editing ideas before we have them. The cartoonist Tom Gauld says he stays away from the computer until he's done most of the thinking for his strips, because once the computer is involved, "things are on an inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless."

{{< callout info >}}
* Scribble on paper, as much as possible. Clear the huge "paper clog".
{{< /callout >}}

#### 🧪 5. Side Projects and Hobbies Are Important

One thing I've learned in my brief career: It's the side projects that really take off. **By side projects I mean the stuff that you thought was just messing around. Stuff that's just play. That's actually the good stuff. That's when the magic happens**.

Take time to be bored. One time I heard a coworker say, "When I get busy, I get stupid." Ain't that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing.

{{< callout note >}}
* I get some of my best ideas when I'm bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners.
* I love ironing my shirts—it's so boring, I almost always get good ideas.
* If you're out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk.
* Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can.
{{< /callout>}}

{{< callout info >}}
* I do this so often. Let me now do more, minus the YouTube. Lower the fader. Let you mind wander and explore.
* While wondering, capture the relevant thoughts.
{{< /callout>}}


As the artist Maira Kalman says, "Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind." Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it's going to lead you.

"You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards."

**Tomlinson suggests that if you love different things, you just keep spending time with them. "Let them talk to each other. Something will begin to happen."**

Music feeds into their work.

**A hobby is something that gives but doesn't take**. While my art is for the world to see, music is only for me and my friends. We get together every Sunday and make noise for a couple of hours. No pressure, no plans. It's regenerative. It's like church.

Don't throw any of yourself away. Don't worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don't worry about unity - what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. One day, you'll look back and it will all make sense.

#### 🌐 6. The Secret: Do Good Work and Share It with People

This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you're doing really good work. **There's no pressure when you're unknown**. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you're unknown, there's nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on. You'll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.

**Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.**

It's a two-step process. Step one, "do good work," is incredibly hard. There are no shortcuts. **Make stuff every day. Know you're going to suck for a while. Fail. Get better**. Step two, "share it with people," was really hard up until about ten years ago or so. Now, it's very simple: "Put your stuff on the Internet."

#### ✈️ 7. Geography Is No Longer Our Master

You don’t have to live anywhere other than the place you are to start connecting with the world you want to be in. If you feel stuck somewhere, if you are too young or tool old or too broke, or if your are somewhat tied down to a place, take heart. There’s a community of people out there you can connect with.

**Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. Create your own world.**

{{< callout note >}}
Your brain gets too comfortable in your everyday surroundings. You need to make it uncomfortable. You need to spend time in another land, among people that do things differently than you. Travel makes the work look new, and when the world looks new, our brains work harder.
{{< /callout>}}

It helps to live around interesting people, and not necessarily people who do what you do. I feel a little incestuous when I hang out with only writers and artist, so I enjoy the many filmmakers, musicians, and tech geeks who live in Austin. Oh, and food. The food should be good. You have to find a place that feed you - creatively, socially, spritually and literally.

#### 🤝 8. Be Nice (The World Is a Small Town)

Remember "garbage in, garbage out"? **You’re only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with**. In the digital space, that means following the best people online—the people who are way smarter and better than you, the people who are doing the really interesting work. Pay attention to what they’re talking about, what they’re doing, what they’re linking to.

{{< callout note >}}
**"Find the most talented person in the room, and if it’s not you, go stand next to him. Hang out with him. Try to be helpful."**
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout info >}}
* I find it so difficult to break the barrier of his/her ego, to approach the **most talented person in the room**. Or is it my ego barrier.
* The least I could do is go out and given genuine complement. Anyway I don't appreciate the people who suck.
* It is so easy to appreciate people who are good. They can always take a good compliment.
{{< /callout >}}

**If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.**

But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try to channel it into my writing and my drawing.

{{< callout info >}}
Let your hurt, pain, anger, sorrow, frustration show in the work that you do, the dance that you dance.
{{< /callout >}}

So go on, get angry. But keep your mouth shut and go do your work. "Complain about the way other people make software by making software."

So, I recommend public fan letters. The Internet is really good for this. Write a blog post about someone’s work that you admire and link to their site. Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they’ve asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online.

The trouble with creative work: Sometimes by the time people catch on to what’s valuable about what you do, you’re either a) bored to death with it, or b) dead. You can’t go looking for validation from external sources. **Once you put your work into the world, you have no control over the way people will react to it.**

**Not everybody will get it. People will misinterpret you and what you do.** They might even call you names. So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored—the trick is to be too busy doing your work to care.

{{< callout info >}}
Keep going. Keep up with the Drills.
{{< /callout >}}

Life is a lonely business, often filled with discouragement and rejection. Yes, validation is for parking, but it’s still a tremendous boost when people say nice things about our work.

{{< callout info >}}
* I should more often stop and appeciate people for their talent, and hard work.
* I should also learn to appreciate myself, which I rarely do.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout note >}}
Instead of keeping a rejection file, keep a praise file. Use it sparingly—don’tget lost in past glory- but keep it around for when you need the lift.
{{< /callout >}}

Occasionally, I have the good fortune to have something take off online, and for a week or two, I’ll be swimming in Tweets and nice e-mails from people discovering my work. It’s pretty wonderful. And disorienting. And a major high.

{{< callout note >}}
 **But I always know that high will taper off, and a few weeks down the road I will have a dark day when I want to quit, when I wonder why the heck I even bother with this stuff.**
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout info >}}
* I wonder so often, what is all this quest about. Anyway eventually all this will come to end.

"Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work."

{{< callout comment >}}
* On a regular day, I spend a lot of time, **re-arranging** things. If I a orderly in the first place, I will have bit more time, but a lot of peace of mind.

"It’s better to burn out than to fade away."

The truth is that even if you’re lucky enough to make a living off doing what you truly love, it will probably take you a while to get to that point. Until then, you’ll need a day job. **A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine. Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art**.

The solution is really simple: Figure out what time you can carve out, what time you can steal, and stick to your routine. **Do the work every day, no matter what. No holidays, no sick days. Don’t stop. What you’ll probably find is that the corollary to Parkinson’s Law is usually true: Work gets done in the time available.**

The trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn’t make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time. Good day jobs aren’t necessarily easy to find, but they’re out there.

Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time. **Writing a page each day doesn’t seem like much, but do it for 365 days and you have enough to fill a novel**. One successful client pitch is a small victory, but a few dozen of them can get you a promotion.

**Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day**. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.

**Just as you need a chart of future events, you also need a chart of past events. A logbook isn’t necessarily a diary or a journal**, it’s just a little book in which you list the things you do every day. What project you worked on, where you went to lunch, what movie you saw. It’s much easier than keeping a detailed diary, and you’d be amazed at how helpful having a daily record like this can be, especially over several years. The small details will help you remember the big details.

"If you ask yourself ‘What’s the **best thing that happened today**?’ it actually forces a certain kind of cheerful retrospection that pulls up from the recent past things to write about that you wouldn’t otherwise think about. If you ask yourself ‘What happened today?’ it’s very likely that you’re going to remember the worst thing, because you’ve had to deal with it—you’ve had to rush somewhere or somebody said something mean to you—that’s what you’re going to remember. But if you ask what the best thing is, it’s going to be some particular slant of light, or some wonderful expression somebody had, or some particularly delicious salad."

Who you marry is the most important decision you’ll ever make. And "marry well" doesn’t just mean your life partner—**it also means who you do business with, who you befriend, who you choose to be around. Relationships are hard enough, but it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who’s obsessed with a creative pursuit**. Lots of times you have to be a maid, a cook, a motivational

#### ➖ 10. Creativity Is Subtraction


{{< callout note >}}
In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who **figure out what to leave out**, so they can concentrate on what’s really important to them. Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities. The idea that you can do anything is absolutely terrifying.
{{< /callout >}}

The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts.

{{< callout note >}}
Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now.
{{< /callout >}}

The artist Saul Steinberg said, “What we respond to in any work of art is the artist’s struggle against his or her limitations.” It’s often what an artist chooses to leave out that makes the art interesting. What isn’t shown versus what is. It’s the same for people: What makes us interesting isn’t just what we’ve experienced, but also what we haven’t experienced. The same is true when you do your work: You must embrace your limitations and keep moving. In the end, creativity isn’t just the things we choose to put in, it’s the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely. And have fun.
