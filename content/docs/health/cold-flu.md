Improving Immunity & Resistance to Cold and Flu

Given a lifestyle that includes regular weight training, yoga, and Latin dance, baseline fitness is already strong. Seasonal issues during Pune winters (cold and asthma flare-ups) are more related to respiratory sensitivity and environmental triggers than weak immunity.

The focus should be on **respiratory immunity, recovery, and winter-specific habits**.

---

#### 🫁 1. Strengthen respiratory immunity (most important)

Cold air, dust, and pollution during winter irritate airways.

**Daily practices**

- **Saline nasal spray or neti pot 3–4 times a week**. Clears allergens before they trigger asthma.
- Steam inhalation **2–3 times a week**
  Use plain water or ajwain.
  Avoid strong menthol oils if asthma is sensitive.
- **Protect chest and neck from cold air, especially after gym or dance sessions**.

---

#### 🏋️‍♂️ 2. Adjust workouts during winter

Overtraining can reduce immunity even when fitness levels are high.

- Extend warm-up duration to **10–15 minutes**
- Avoid very intense late-night workouts
- Slightly reduce training volume if cold symptoms appear
- Change out of sweaty clothes immediately after workouts

The combination of yoga, strength training, and dance is excellent — recovery becomes more important in winter.

#### 🥗 3. Food-based immunity (before supplements)

**Daily essentials**
- **Warm foods** in the morning and night
- One **citrus fruit** daily (orange, mosambi, amla)
- **Ginger and turmeric** in food or tea
- **Garlic 3–4 times per week**

**Protein intake**
Low protein reduces immunity.
Ensure adequate intake from:
- Eggs, Paneer, Curd, Dal
- Whey protein (if used)

**Avoid during winter**
- Cold water, Ice creams and cold smoothies, Excess sugar (suppresses immune response)

---

#### 🧘‍♂️ 4. Yogic practices for asthma and cold

Add these to the existing yoga routine.

**Pranayama**

- Anulom Vilom – daily
- Bhramari – calms airways effectively
- Avoid forceful Kapalbhati during active cold

**Asanas**

- Bhujangasana
- Setu Bandhasana
- Matsyasana

---

#### 😴 5. Sleep and recovery

Often overlooked by active individuals.

- Sleep **7–8 hours** minimum
- Avoid cold air directly on face while sleeping
- Keep feet warm at night

---

#### 🏠 6. Environmental control (Pune-specific)

- Use a humidifier or keep a bowl of water near the bed
- Vacuum bed, sofa, and curtains weekly
- Wash blankets and pillow covers frequently during winter

---

#### 💊 7. Supplements (only if required)

If lifestyle and diet are consistent but symptoms persist:

- Vitamin D (commonly deficient)
- Vitamin C (short-term during cold season)
- Omega-3 (supports inflammation and asthma control)

Always consult a doctor before long-term supplementation.
