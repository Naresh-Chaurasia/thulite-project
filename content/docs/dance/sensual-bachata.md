#### 🌊 Body Awareness & Isolation

Sensual bachata is **less about steps and more about how your body moves**.

#### 🤝 Connection Before Movement

In sensual bachata, **connection comes first**, movement second.

- Maintain gentle but clear contact (hand, frame, or body)
- **Move with her, not around her**
- Feel her balance and timing before initiating anything

If connection is right, even simple movements feel sensual.
